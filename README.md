## How It Works

### Background Service Worker
- Manages AI sessions for each tab
- Creates `LanguageModel` sessions when tabs are activated or updated
- Handles prompt requests and forwards them to Chrome's AI APIs

### Side Panel
- Provides the user interface for interaction
- Handles summarization using `Summarizer.create()`
- Sends prompts to the background worker for processing
- Streams responses back for smooth display

### Content Script
- Extracts and formats page content
- Filters out unnecessary elements (scripts, styles, etc.)
- Prepares clean text for AI processing

## Technologies Used

- **Chrome Extensions Manifest V3**: Latest extension architecture
- **Chrome AI APIs**:
  - `LanguageModel`: For interactive Q&A
  - `Summarizer`: For page summarization
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS for all functionality
- **HTML/CSS**: Modern, gradient-based UI

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `activeTab`: To access the current tab's content
- `scripting`: To inject content scripts
- `storage`: To manage extension data
- `sidePanel`: To display the side panel interface
- `tabs`: To track tab changes and manage sessions
- `host_permissions`: To access web page content
